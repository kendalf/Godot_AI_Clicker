Simple mobile game concept I'm working on. I've always liked clicker games so I decided to make one focused on AI with some historical educational content. Right now its mostly just a generic clicker game but I'm trying to think of ways to make the gameplay more unique. 

Hopefully this will get released on Android and IOS and maybe a steam version if I can manage it.

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome!
